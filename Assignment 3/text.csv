The batches of 1960,1970,1985,1995 and 2005 were felicitated on the occasion of completing their Diamond, Golden, Coral, Silver and Crystal Jubilees respectively. The college ground was lit up with lights and décor as it welcomed back its students from the past years. This day will be marked in history as a remarkable day not just for the alumni but everyone present there, including the faculty and the currently enrolled students. There was an abundance of smiles, laughter, nostalgic stories and memories being spread around in the air. Homecoming 2020 offers the road down memory lane and a path to creating new ones."
"p","As every auspicious ceremony should begin, this event began with the lighting of the lamp. Following this, Dean Alumni, Corporate and International Relations, Dr. Divya Bansal in her address informed how within five weeks the event was pulled off and total registrations with families had exceeded 1000. She also shed some light on how the engagement with the alumni had tremendously improved in the last three months with all possible communication media used to reach the alumni world over including Facebook, linked in, emails, phones calls, WhatsApp. As a result alumni from all over the world including Malaysia, Australia, US, Nepal, Canada, London attended the event. The Director of the institute, Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi, who had joined the college last year and has made immense improvements within the span of a year, also addressed the crowd. PEC celebrated and cherished 4 of its distinguished alumni by presenting them with an award. Amongst them were Mr.Sandeep Bakhshi (Director and CEO of ICICI Bank for the past 32 years, who has handled various assignments across the group in ICICI Limited, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, ICICI Bank and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and graduated PEC in 1982) whose presence we missed, Mr. Sanjeev Aggarwal (Founder and CEO of Daksh, rated as the World's Best Managed BPO Company (Black Book of Outsourcing) and was ranked as the #1 employer in Indian BPO market by IDC. He was chosen ""Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the year"" in 2002), Mr. Sanjay Bhatia (Chairman, Mumbai Port Trust.

"p","To make the ceremony more personal, representatives from each Jubilee were called upon stage to share their views about the college, their batch mates and any advice they had to offer to the younglings present in the venue."
"p","Punjab Engineering College welcomed with open arms, Bikram Singh Garewal, the college’s oldest alum. Having graduated in 1943, this imminent personality is a mighty 97-year-old humble man who achieved great feats in life. He served as the Chief Engineer of Patiala from 1971 till his retirement in 1981. Originating from Lahore, he was more than happy to celebrate his birthday today amongst his juniors of various generations in the college where he studied as a young lad."
"p","Following a quick but delicious entrée of dishes, the alumni members along with their families were invited to participate in fun activities which included kite flying, musical chair, tug of war, football and various other leisure activities. With the air filled with music and food in the corner, people were excited to come forward to dance and enjoy the moment. Photographs were taken as the proud winners of the games stood to collect their prizes."
"p","Nukkad Nattak was performed by the students of Dramatics Club outside the auditorium soon after the fun activities. The hungry crowd soon left for a hearty lunch in the football ground. As the sun beat down on PEC on this mildly cold February day, there were only stories to pass around and nostalgic memories lingering in the atmosphere. When asked around to various alumni members of ranging years, there were many special stories and interesting facts being told around. From having just 3 branches (mechanical, civil and electrical), the college has indeed come a long way by now accommodating 8 branches. They were all pleased to see the new changes being brought about in the college whilst keeping the old infrastructure intact."
"p","By late noon, the alumni members were shown around the college for their respective branch tour. Just as the new students being enrolled into the college are taken around the various departments, the alumni were too, but this time, each place held a special memory for them. There was also a panel discussion being held in the senate hall regarding a very important topic-How the alumni of Punjab engineering College could strengthen their network. Shortly after, to conclude this wonderful day, a gala dinner was hosted at the football ground. With a brief and touching vote of thanks, the night led to a fest of songs and bhangra performances by the students.

"p","Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University) has completed 98 wonderful years since it’s foundation in 1921. A celebratory event was organized to mark the foundation of the college, which started with a lamp lightning ceremony. Chief guest Director, PEC, Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi, ex-Directors Vijay Gupta and Manoj Datta shared the podium with Dr. Divya Bansal. The Chief Guests also included Dr. Siby John (Deputy Director) and Dr. Sushant Samir (Registrar)."
"p","The lamp lighting ceremony was followed by the Director’s speech, where he started off by wishing Punjab Engineering College, a very happy 98th Birthday. He highlighted his vision for the University and re-emphasized his plans to promote internships and taking up transferred semesters in various institutions and universities to gain lots of exposure, something which is lacking in a lot of graduates of recent time. He also highlighted that Punjab Engineering College has the ‘top 1%’ of students, and inherently it becomes the responsibility of the University to provide them with apt care, attention and opportunities. His moto, change India by taking one step at a time, was highlighted to seek as much help, and as much experience as one possibly could, as it is only then that you learn."
"p","He then introduced Dr. Vijay Gupta, and elucidated that they both had a similar vision of what they wanted PEC to be. Dr. Gupta began on a light and yet an emotional note, stating that he was surprised he needed a microphone, as he had taken many a lecture in the same hall, behind the same podium, to an Auditorium full of students, without ever needing a mic. His golden rule, he stated, was that he believed in making many mistakes, but he’d rather err while experimenting than practicing. He too recognized the fact that providing a good student experience was paramount above all things. He then talked about how India still follows a science-based education system which is out of touch with our time and requirements. His speech was supplemented by Dr. Dutta. He opened his speech with a remarkable idea of ‘Free and Unrestricted Choice for Education’ and emphasized on continuous self-evaluation as a key to success. His main idea was that the University should take examples from other institutions, but never try to copy or clone them, the variance that a University provides over other institution is what attracts people. He also stated his idea about restructuring the M.Tech programs and provide more focus on them. His ideas to promote the entrepreneurship and start-ups in India were vivid and he highlighted the errs in using the ranking system for colleges and how they may be inaccurate and might lose their purpose."
"p","A dance performance by the Dramatics Club of PEC, and a video entailing the history of PEC and its highlights helped to raise the energy in the room."
"p","The event ended by Dr. Divya Bansal thanking all dignitaries and students present there for helping make this day truly memorable."

"p","The major concern is that when the institute opens for the next semester, several of PEC students would face economic hardships. Due to lockdown and consequent economic slowdown, we suspect that parents of many students would lose their jobs or have substantially reduced earnings. A couple of students have already approached us in this regard. We seek your contributions so that we can help such students. We encourage and gladly accept all gifts, no amount is too small."
"p","Punjab Engineering College Chandigarh is looking to establish several scholarships for its students through philanthropic contributions. Currently, an undergraduate student spends roughly Rs. 2.5 lakhs a year on tuition, lodging and boarding.

"p","Description: The aim of the institution always remains to focus on the students’ overall development, whether it’s technical skills, cultural activities’ participation or academic skill set. With the same objective in mind, The Voyager Program introduces a new experience for the students of Punjab Engineering College (Deemed To Be University) giving them an opportunity for a holistic personality development."
"p","The program involves students visiting various Indian states during the summer break in groups of 3 (up to a maximum of 5 groups) allowing them to explore the country and the various communities and cultures that exist within. It involves students exploring the diverse corners of the country with minimal materialistic requirements, focussing on and diving into the beautifully diverse places, people and living conditions."
"p","Purpose: The objective of this program is to expose the students to the widely varying living conditions, cultures, values, traditions, beliefs, climate, and geographical conditions all over the country. It aims to engage students with different aspects of life by divulging them into raw social interaction giving them perspective into communities, people and difference in characteristics. It teaches them the importance of experience rather than materialistic things as they have to travel and stay in minimal living conditions in unfamiliar territories. It introduces them to circumstances where they have to enter into dialogue with people from different walks of life."
"p","The biggest take away from the program is gaining a perspective on life and the realisation of what things matter to them in life, their ambitions and an opportunity to break socially constructed aspirations. It is an attempt to instil qualities such as inquisitiveness, curiosity, retrospection, compassion and commitment in the fellows."
"p","The program is not a tourist experience; it’s a journey of exploring where the fellows will be discovering the country rather than enjoying a vacation. They will enter unknown territories and unknown adventures. The aim is for them to discover themselves during the process of discovering the country."
"p","Guidelines: The program is governed by the following general guidelines:"
"p","Report: The teams will have to submit a detailed report of their 30-40 day journey, featuring every location, duration, their learning, take away and experience. Formulation of the trip around a theme, describing anecdotes, friends etc. are some things that the recollection of the trip can contain."

The papers are in the top one per cent of the most-cited articles in each subject category along with the most-cited review article published in the last three years."
"p","In this article, Sanjeev Kumar and his co-authors reported the effect of Sr and Mn doping on the electrical and magnetic characteristics of BiFeO3 nanoparticles, synthesized by sol-gel technique. They observed that Sr doping in BiFeO3 showed substantial reduction in the leakage current whilst co-doping with Sr and Mn led to lower reduction in the leakage current through offering better performance over undoped BiFeO3, due to changes brought in the defect physics upon doping. Additionally, Sr and Mn co-doped BiFeO3 samples exhibit enhanced magnetization in comparison to undoped and Sr doped BiFeO3, possibly due to interruptions in the spin cycloid of BiFeO3."
